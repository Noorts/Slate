## Info
Slate is my portfolio site. The second version of my portfolio is now live over on [https://noorts.me](https://noorts.me). An [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend and a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) CMS were used to build it.

## Roadmap
* Add image functionality to project cards
* Implement full CI/CD
* Use different technologies (Next.js) so that the website can be generated to static files and the live Strapi instance is no longer necessary

## Acknowledgements
My portfolio its design has been heavily inspired by [Hector Simpson](https://hector.me/). Thanks to him for the inspiration.
