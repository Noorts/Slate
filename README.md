## Info
Slate is my portfolio site. Its version 1 is still in development and not live yet. An [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend and a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) CMS were used to build it.

## Roadmap
* Add 3D animation to landing area
* Add image functionality to project cards
* Implement full CI/CD
* Use different technologies (Next.js) so that the website can be generated to static files and the live Strapi instance is no longer necessary
* Revamp website to a compact design

## License
Slate is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
